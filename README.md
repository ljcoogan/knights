# Knights

Knights and knaves is a simple type of logic puzzle. Knights will always tell the truth, knaves will always lie. This is an implementation of this type of puzzle using Spring and React.

On the backend, I use Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Security (with OAuth2), Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate and H2), and Lombok. On the frontend, I use Typescript, TSX, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Here is a screenshot of the game.
